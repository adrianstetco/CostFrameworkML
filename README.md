<p>In many real world applications of machine learning, the cost of acquiring measurements varies significantly. As businesses operate in resource-constrained environments, a question that arises is which combination of signals results in the most accurate models given a fixed budget. Conversely, if more accurate models are needed, what signals increase accuracy at lowest cost? This paper introduces a three-stage framework for integrating data acquisition cost into time-series applications based on signal
ablation. Stage 1 constructs a time-series predictive model utilizing all relevant signals to assess the maximum accuracy achievable with an unlimited budget. Stage 2 randomizes each signal independently, computing the degradation in accuracy incurred on the underlying model. This process is achieved either by shuffling of its measurements or random sampling from signalâ€™s distribution. Utilizing the resulting estimated signals accuracy and their acquisition cost, Stage 3 solves the knapsacklike combinatorial optimization problem of picking the right combination of signals maximizing total accuracy given any fixed budget. The proposed framework is showcased on a synthetic time-series dataset which allows us to control the cost distribution in order to understand how the system works in different scenarios.</p>
